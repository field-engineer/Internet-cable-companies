Access networks and passive optical networks

Operators currently offer broadband services via DSL, mainly ADSL. The deployment of these systems represents a natural evolution of the copper plant, but the truth is that these technologies represent only an intermediate step, due to transmission limitations of copper lines that restrict the range of broadband services. A "true" broadband access requires fiber-optic infrastructure to overcome bottlenecks.

The [Cable internet companies](https://www.fieldengineer.com/blogs/observations-solutions-cables-companies/)are in market. With the deployment of the IP and its associated concepts, the traditional idea of the topology of the access network needs to be revised, both on the side of its architecture and its functions. The flexibility of the network is an important aspect, and unlike the past, routing and / or switching will become one more function of the access network and there will be "intelligent" active nodes. In addition, network topologies, such as the mesh and ring type will be used in the access network to provide flexible and cost-effective connections, fiber is a key factor that will allow the evolution of the access network. In summary, the functions and architectures originally developed for Core networks will appear in the next generation access networks. This process will be accompanied and supported by a reduction in costs.

This evolution and change means that the established design and access network engineering rules have to be changed, and new models have to be explored to allow the deployment of new concepts in the access network of the next generation.

Optical Fiber Attenuation is considered the fundamental factor that limits the performance of fiber optic communication systems. The losses reduce the average power that reaches the receiver.

The transmission distance is an inherent limitation of the fiber optic system, if we consider that the receivers require a minimum amount of power to recognize the transmission signal.

The advantages given by the low attenuation presented by the optical fibers with respect to conventional conductors.
The following figure shows the spectrum of the attenuation curve of a typical optical fiber made of silicon. The curve has three main characteristics. A great tendency to attenuate as the wavelength increases (Rayleigh Dispersion), attenuation at the absorption peaks associated with the hydroxyl ion (OH-) and a tendency to increase the attenuation at wavelengths above 1.6 Î¼m , due to the losses induced by the absorption of silicon.

Optical Fiber Attenuation

Attenuation can be caused by several factors which can be classified into two categories: Intrinsic and Extrinsic.
I. Intrinsic Attenuation Occurs due to something internal or inherent to the fiber, and is caused by the impurities of the glass during the manufacturing process. The most precise manufacturing methodology has not managed to eliminate all the impurities, although technological advances have caused a dramatic decrease in attenuation. If the light signal hits with an impurity, two things can happen: it can spread or it can be absorbed.
